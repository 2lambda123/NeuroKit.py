# Contribution Guidelines
**All people are very much welcome to contribute to code, testing and suggestions.**

## Code
- Authors of code contribution will be added within the "contributor" section within the documentation.
- Authors of code contribution are invited to follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style sheet to write some nice (and readable) python.
- Please document and comment your code, so that the purpose of each step (or code line) is stated in a clear and understandable way.
- Avoid unnecessary function splitting into smaller bits: it makes testing and reading of the code more difficult (as one must jump between functions to understand what's happening).
